### **Stephanie K. Archer, PI**  
I completed my PhD at North Carolina State University where I worked in the Layman Lab studying how sponges alter community composition and ecosystem function in tropical and subtropical nearshore marine ecosystems. I then moved on to work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada in multiple capacities. There I studied species interactions and ecosystem function of Glass Sponge Reefs and worked to develop efficient monitoring methods grounded in a strong understanding of the behavior and ecology of keystone species. I am now an Assistant Professor at LUMCON establishing a local research program focused on coastal Louisiana’s sponges, oyster reefs, and other biogenic habitats. Outside of work I have a healthy obsession with University of Georgia football (go Dawgs!), love to cook and read, and enjoy gardening, kayaking, and generally being outside.

I completed my undergraduate at the State University of New York College at Oneonta where I worked on several projects. I did field work on Andros Island, The Bahamas to collect a comprehensive population survey for the Bahamas National Trust to help develop a management plan for the National Park dedicated to conserving the giant land crab (Crab Replenishment Reserve). In addition to field work, I tested the effects of curcumin on respiration in yeast cells in my undergraduate’s biochemistry laboratory and performed a computational clustering analysis to view age cohorts of the larval form of a North American insect species within a stream. I moved to Louisiana and am now a Research Technician at LUMCON in the Archer Benthic Ecology Lab, primarily working on oyster reef community ecology and Louisiana sponges. I hope to attain my master’s and Ph.D. in biology, focusing on the exploitation of commodity species and how their absence or decline can affect their surrounding ecosystems. Outside of science, I love to play volleyball, read, watch movies, and play board games with my friends!
